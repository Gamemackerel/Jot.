# Jot.

An elegant, ultra minimal Android notes app, with only one page of notes.

~[Available on the google play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hamandeggs.jot)~

Jot is being deprecated, and replaced by [Scratch Paper](https://github.com/Gamemackerel/scratch-paper-mobile-app/tree/main), which is both Android and iOS compatible, and accomodates some new google play store requirements.
